# Comments in English

- **Code comments**: Write all inline comments, block comments, and JSDoc/TSDoc in **English**.
- **Docstrings**: Use English for function/class/module documentation.
- **TODO / FIXME**: Prefer English (e.g. `// TODO: refactor validation` instead of non-English text).

This keeps the codebase consistent for contributors across locales and matches common open-source practice.
